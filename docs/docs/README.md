- title: Simple
  details: It's hard to boil things down to their simplest form in technology. This is why having a layer of abstraction on strong cryptography and Bitcoin is oogway's priority.
- title: Convenient
  details: The library comes with most functions developers need to build on Bitcoin without digging into low-level stuff. It even has a CLI for running test functions in a dev environment.
